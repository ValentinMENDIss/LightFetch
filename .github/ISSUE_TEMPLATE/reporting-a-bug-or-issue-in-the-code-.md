**1. Describe the bug**
Describe the bug or issue with code you encountered clearly.

**Question Help:**
    - What is the bug? (what does not work as expected?)
    - When it occurs? (when can this bug be encountered?)
*If it is hard to explain images can be posted to show what exactly is not working correct.*

**2. Describe how to Reproduce it**
Describe how can it be encountered / how to reproduce it.

**Help**
1. Go to '...'
2. Change this to '....'
3. Execute the main code
4. See error

**3. Expected behavior**
If it is self explained what should have happened (For example: changing 'Show-RAM-Usage' doesn't do anything.), than you can skip this step. Else it will be great if the expected behavior from user will be given, so the bug could be easier to fix or find.

In this step describe *clearly* what you expected to happen.


**4. Screenshots**
How I said in the 'Describe the bug' section, If the problem is complex or not hard to describe and explain , add screenshots to visualize the problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [for example: Linux Gentoo; OpenBSD; MacOS, etc.]
 - Version of the OS: [for example: linux 6.6.42-1-lts  x86_64]

**5. Additional context**
If the additional context is needed to properly describe the problem, bug or issue, don't forget to add it.
