# LightFetch

**LightFetch** is a fetch program written in pure C programming language. :)

## So, what it does?
You may already know what fetch programs are, but if not,I will tell here. 
Fetch programs and this aswell can show your  basic hardware information. Such as,
Your OS/Distribution, Kernel (Version of OS), Architecture(64, 32 bit...), Hostname;
GPU and CPU (Name and Vendor), etc...


## Why have I created it?
The question why I wanted to create fetch program, is because 
I use fetch programs very often, as for example when I am trying new/old hardware, (playing with it), trying new Distributions / OSes, and just to see if everything on system works fine, if ram has been found and even more...

As why I created it, is because I wanted to dive in in C programming language (to expand my knowledge in it). And I wanted to see how fetch programs work, and where might be some difficulties. And I am being honest, I have learned a lot here. As I am only a beginner in C programming language (though I know Python pretty well :) ). 

### I hope you liked it as much as I did :)
And I hope that this fetch program will be useful for someone...


Best wishes,
Valentin :)
